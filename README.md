<b>Clone</b> into the environment

<b>Install Dependencies</b>

npm test
```

## Plan
Generate Javascript sdk for contracts through <br>

- [x] development environment
- [x] block explorer url
- [x] Smart Contracts only (No development environment)

Other possibilities
How react hooks can be manipulated to automatically implement jags

### Ideal run
1. jags [network] dev-env
2. jags [block-explorer-url]
3. jags [network] [file/path/to/smart-contract]
4. jags [network] [file/path/to/abi]

Possibilities <br>
... react [file/path/to/react-env]
